# Circle of life

This is a game developped during the Global Game Jam 2016.
The theme was ritual and the game is based on that particular theme. 

Throughout the game, the player must go through a series of ritual 
to acquire new skills and get older. The purpose of the player is
to finally become a shaman at the end of the game and get ready 
to form a new generation of shamans in training.
